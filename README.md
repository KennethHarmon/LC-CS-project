# LC-CS-project

This is my project I created for my Leaving Cert Computer Science Project 2020. 
I had to follow this brief: 
> The Task
> Design a computational artefact under the theme of Climate Change. The purpose of this artefact
> is to use existing data to educate people about the impact of climate change.
> The artefact should make use of existing datasets and should allow the end user to interpret the
> chosen data and identify trends through graphs and/or visualisations. There should be an
> interactive element to the artefact so that the user can decide what data they wish to see
> represented in the graph or visualisation.
